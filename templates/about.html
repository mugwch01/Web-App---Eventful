<p class="text-center"> The Event application was made for academic purposes. The application uses weekly xml data from eventful. The data for the events and performers was limited to Decorah and Minneapolis. Only Events that had performers were used by the application, i.e, if an Event did not have a performer, the event was not included. The application uses as sql heroku database. The database is limited to 10,000 rows per table, and that may be an issue in scaling the application. The database has 3 tables: Events, Performers, and Event_Performers. The Event_Performer table links the events to the performers who are performing at that event. The usage of the application is basic. If the user searches for an event,a list of performers for that event will be displayed. If the user searches for a performer, a list of events that the performer will be performing at will be displayed. In addition, the user can make general search to the database where we list out relevant information as per the query. When the requested information is unavailable, our application returns empty table. The application also has a page that has a list of all the events that have performers sorted according to their start date. If you have any questios, please contact the developers using either of the following emails: beyeas01@luther.edu, mugwch01@luther.edu.</p>
