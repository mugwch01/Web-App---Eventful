# Eventful Web App

A web application that keeps track of events and artists. For each event, the user could search for the performers, and for each performer, the user could search for the events the performer would be performing at. Please note that I worked with one collaborator on this project. I was mostly focused on the back-end, the database side of the application. I also played a huge roll in the overall design of the whole project.
  
  This application was developed for Academic purposes.
